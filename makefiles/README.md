# Makefile

Run and compile your programs more efficiently with this handy automation tool.

If you want to run or update a task when certain files are updated, the `make` utility can come in handy. The `make` utility requires a file, `Makefile` (or `makefile`), which defines set of tasks to be executed. You may have used `make` to compile a program from source code. Most open source projects use `make` to compile a final executable binary, which can then be installed using `make install`.

```
sudo apt install make
```
