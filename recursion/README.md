# Recursion

- > Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
- > A recursive function is a function that calls itself, is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.
